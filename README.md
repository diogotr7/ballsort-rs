# ballsort-rs

Rust port of my [C# project](https://github.com/diogotr7/BallSort) as a way to learn the language.

This is probably not particularly idiomatic rust, but it's functional and runs in about 1/3 the time of the c# version.

The goal with writing this in rust is eventually to make a webassembly version of it to create a web version of the solver.
