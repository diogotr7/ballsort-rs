## 🟧 Disclaimers  
> _This is probably not particularly idiomatic rust, but it's entirely functional and executes in about 33.33% of the previous runtime from my `C#` version._

## 🟩 Goals
The use of `Rust` in this port of my previously-`C#` based project is to eventually create a **webassembly version** from this base, allowing me to then finally **deploy a web-based version** of the solver, which would be much more user-friendly and allow the project to be used by many more poeple.

**Runtime decreased _at least_** `2x` **in most cases!**
